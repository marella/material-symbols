## Usage

Material Symbols are available in three styles&mdash;`outlined`, `rounded`, and `sharp`. Path strings are available for both unfilled (`FILL` 0) and filled (`FILL` 1) states with grade (`GRAD`) 0 and size (`opsz`) 48px. Other variations of grade and size are not included to keep the package size small. Exports are prefixed `ms` followed by a camelCase version of the corresponding SVG file name. If the icon is filled, "Filled" is appended to the export. Path strings for each icon are located in the corresponding style directory.

For example:

| Icon       | Style      | Fill | Export Name        | Import Path                                   |
|------------|------------|------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `home`     | `outlined` | 0    | `msHome`           | `@material-symbols/path-600/outlined/` |
| `search`   | `rounded`  | 0    | `msSearch`         | `@material-symbols/path-600/rounded/`  |
| `favorite` | `sharp`    | 1    | `msFavoriteFilled` | `@material-symbols/path-600/sharp/`    |

The above translates to the following import statements:
```js
import { msHome } from '@material-symbols/path-600/outlined';
import { msSearch } from '@material-symbols/path-600/rounded';
import { msFavoriteFilled } from '@material-symbols/path-600/sharp';
```

### Example

*The following example uses React, but the concept applies anywhere ES modules are supported.*

```js
import { msHome } from '@material-symbols/path-600/outlined';

// msHome = "M220-180h150v-250h220v250h150v-3..."

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <svg width="48" height="48" viewBox="0 -960 960 960">
            <path d={msHome} />
        </svg>
    </div>
  );
}
```
